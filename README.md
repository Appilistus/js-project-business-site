# AI Compass | AI Education for Children

Welcome to the **AI Compass** website project! This is a responsive landing page for an AI education platform designed for children, built to showcase a modern, engaging business site.

## 🌟 Project Overview

**AI Compass** is a fictional AI education platform for children, created as a concept for this project. The website is a landing page design where potential customers (parents and teachers) would ideally learn about the curriculum, understand the value of AI education, and sign up for trial classes.

This project was built as part of a coding bootcamp assignment to demonstrate skills in building responsive business websites.

The site is designed to be friendly, safe, and trustworthy, with a focus on:
- **Education Programs**: Tailored for different age groups (Elementary to High School).
- **Why AI**: Explaining the importance of AI literacy.
- **Safety**: Emphasizing a secure learning environment.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Navigation**:
  - Sticky navigation bar.
  - Hamburger menu for mobile views with a smooth overlay effect.
  - "Back to Top" button that appears after scrolling.
- **Hero Video Background**: A dynamic video loop in the hero section to grab attention.
- **Sign-Up Form**: A dedicated form page with validation to capture user interest (Parent/Teacher, Age Group, Interests).
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Internal links scroll smoothly to their respective sections.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for better accessibility and structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling including:
  - Flexbox for layouts.
  - CSS Variables for consistent coloring.
  - Keyframe animations (e.g., wave effects).
  - Media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**:
  - DOM manipulation for the mobile menu.
  - Event listeners for scroll effects.

2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
3.  To test the form, click the "Get started" button to navigate to the sign-up page.
    *   *Note: The form currently submits to `https://httpbin.org/anything` for demonstration purposes.*

## 🔮 Future Improvements

-   **Backend Integration**: Connect the form to a real backend service (like Netlify Forms or a database) to store user submissions.
-   **More Pages**: Add dedicated pages for "Curriculum Details" or "About Us".
-   **SEO Optimization**: Add more meta tags and descriptions for better search engine visibility.
